# 🧪 Rutherford Scattering Simulation

An interactive web simulation of **Rutherford’s alpha particle scattering experiment** built with React, TypeScript, and Canvas. Visualize how alpha particles scatter when fired at atomic nuclei, tweak experiment parameters in real-time, and observe particle paths and scattering angle distributions.

## 🧬 Concept
- Based on Rutherford’s 1911 experiment, where alpha particles were directed at a thin gold foil to probe the structure of the atom. The simulation illustrates:

- Most particles passing straight through.

- Some deflecting at small angles.

- Rare large-angle deflections revealing a dense, positively charged nucleus.

## 📚 Technologies Used
React with TypeScript

HTML5 Canvas API for 2D rendering

TailwindCSS for styled UI components
